  + not too specialized and not too general (only in=>out, because inefficient: requires milenias of evolution or big resources)
    + explicit objects level

+ start from camera example
  + hardware
  + arduino code
  + pc code
    x c++ instead of java/processing
      x HD 6000 camera doesn't work
        x videoInput library
        x rgb vs yuy2
        x own dsho9w graph
    + python instead of c++
    + port example code

- attention process
  + motion vectors (video compression, what else is in mpeg) => mode 1
    + actually called motion estimation
      x PRA (pel recursive algorithm) : complex
      x BMA (block matching algorithm) : simpe
      x phase corelation
      + optical fglow : in OpenCV
  + automatically creates objects => mode 2
  + system features
    + object oriented
    + performance
      + http://docs.opencv.org/master/dc/d71/tutorial_py_optimization.html#gsc.tab=0
      + info in the same line, not to flood the output
    + control keys: switching modes, ? for help, performance info on/off
    + unit tests
      + batch file to run
  - eyes
    + pass raw frame (gray)
    + normalize (done, but not usefull here)
      + http://docs.opencv.org/master/d5/daf/tutorial_py_histogram_equalization.html#gsc.tab=0 //histogram
    - disable autofocus in camera
      - uvcdynctrl -v -d video1 --set='Focus, Auto' 0
      - uvcdynctrl -v -d video1 --get='Focus, Auto'
  - mode 0 : faces
    - smile inside face
    x what other clasifiers are there? | nothing interesting
    - append smiles (first)
  - mode 1 : optical flow
    + http://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d8b/tutorial_py_lucas_kanade.html#gsc.tab=0 //optical flow
    x histogram equalization too early
    - return flow sum as (1,1) rect from mid screen
    - substract median flow vector not to be dependent on head moves
  - mode 2 : objects detection
    + http://docs.opencv.org/master/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html#gsc.tab=0 //all
    + http://docs.opencv.org/master/d4/d32/minarea_8cpp_example.html#gsc.tab=0 //min enclose rect
    x http://docs.opencv.org/master/db/d5c/tutorial_py_bg_subtraction.html#gsc.tab=0 //remove bg
    - noisy objects from light
      x near edges?
      x cut off value of 1.5 | even 2 is giving crap in different light
      x higher resolution | even worse
      + erosion & dilatation | dilatation used
      - check parameters of this opticalFlow function
    + if bounding rectangles are overlapping then join them
    - if no area then return old
      x return bit to indicate this (no learning)?
      - if target moves out of camera window then it stays | may not be a problem if head moves
      - don't do this for areas on the edge
        - if there is no move and previous flow was out of the screen
    - if new area is inside previously returned then return old
      - if whole screen is selected then we are stuck with this (object too close, light turned on)
    - return biggest area first
      - better sort by flow sum (amplitudes)
    - return also flow image for objects (can be usefull for learning)
    + reset state after head move
    - get rid off .copy()
  - head
    + optimize sending to arduino (now can do it 2x per frame)
    - move head away on bad emotions | add positive or nautral default

- demo for sound
  - multithreading
    - producer&consumer
  - listen and look for change
    - mono first
    - "python record audio": pyAudio, psychopy
  - record till done, wait a sec, replay
  - test of microphone/fft, compression/decompression, speaker
  - don't listen when replay, so no feedback

- objects recognition
  - if I cut some data then give some information
    - for part of image give position and size
    - for normalized colors give mean and dev (so can detect day/night)
  - normalize histogram before
  - return object index
  - draw image from "imagination", reverse signal from neural network
  - emotions coded together here
    - proto-emoions: pleasure, pain

- buttons for reward/punishment
  - this counts for binary senses (feel/pain, taste x5, smells)
  - happy/sad diods
  
- reaction
  - reinforcement learning

- higher quality
  - color
  - 3d view
    - http://docs.opencv.org/master/dd/d53/tutorial_py_depthmap.html#gsc.tab=0
  - microphone array
